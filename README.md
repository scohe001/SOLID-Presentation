# All things S.O.L.I.D.

Welcome to the SOLID repo! This nice place contains the materials and examples that
 we will be using for our presentation for our dev team. In case you're unsure, SOLID
 stands for:

**Single Responsibility Principle**<br>
**Open/Closed Principle**<br>
**Liskov Substitution Principle**<br>
**Interface Segregation Principle**<br>
**Dependency Inversion Principle**

More on solid can be found in [this article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/solid-principles-every-developer-should-know-b3bfa96bb688) or on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).
